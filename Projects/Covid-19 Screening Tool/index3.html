                <h2>COVID-19</h2>
                <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.</p>
                <p>The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, tever, and
                    in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands
                    frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with
                    people who are unwell.
                </p>
                <h4>How it spreads</h4>
                <p>
                    Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they
                    cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus
                    on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
